# ICS-PKU-2017

*Cao Shengcao*

Welcome to ICS! Here is a public repository for the course Introduction to Computer Systems (2017) of Peking University.

We will update the answers for all the homework and labs of the course. Also, some additional learning materials will be provided.

Wish you a nice trip in the world of computer systems!



#### Update 2019/09/18

I have seen some stars recently, thanks if you like this repository! However, this was created in Fall 2017 when I was a TA. Something might have been changed in your course, and I won't be able to update it anymore. Moreover, you are worthy of independent thinking before looking for answers to your homework : )
